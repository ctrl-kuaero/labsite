    ## System Control
    A "system" is a mathematical representation of an object with input and output.
    The analysis and design methodology of systems with dynamics is referred to as "system control." 
    In this laboratory, we construct the theory of system control. 
    Our interest is not limited to aerospace but various systems such as mechanical, electrical, physical, chemical, informational, and social systems.

    The main themes we research include nonlinear control, optimal control, probabilistic system control, robotics, machine learning, and more. 
    The development of these theories requires combining knowledge from various fields, especially linear algebra, differential geometry, functional analysis, analytical mechanics, aerospace dynamics, probability statistics, statistical learning, mechatronics, and computer science.

    In recent years, we have focused on topics such as nonlinear control for mechanical systems with analytical mechanics and nonlinear optimal control based on databases.

    ## System Identification
    When controlling systems, mathematical models representing the dynamics of the target system are crucial. 
    The performance and safety of designed controllers strongly depend on the accuracy of the mathematical model. 
    However, constructing models for systems with complex dynamics is challenging.
    Hence, model construction of systems based on large amounts of data, known as "system identification," becomes necessary.

    We are working on the development of system identification methods using machine learning that can construct models for systems with strong nonlinearity. 
    We also develop control theories that leverage the identified models.

    ## Aerospace Systems
    Aircraft and spacecraft systems require highly precise and highly reliable control. 
    In aviation, the need for multifunctional controls arises, which can handle complex models (e.g. fluids) and large-scale systems (e.g. traffic control), and more.
    Space missions require a delicate balance between high efficiency for fuel and high precision for control in extreme conditions of outer space. 

    We specialize in developing strategies for aerospace control. 
    For example, we study energy-efficient control through trajectory planning using nonlinear optimization methods such as sparse optimization, and we also develop control methods for space rendezvous and attitude stationary, utilizing the spacecraftâ€™s dynamical properties.
    These approaches find applications in a variety of challenges in aeronautics and astronautics.
