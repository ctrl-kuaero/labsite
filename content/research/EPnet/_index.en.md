To control systems like aerospace vehicles, a mathematical model is required. However, many systems are too intricate to construct a mathematical model based solely on physical prior knowledge. Therefore, system identification, which involves building mathematical models from experimental data, is actively researched. We propose a system identification method using machine learning to construct a model that predict future outputs based on past data. The models constructed using this method have the advantage of being applicable to model predictive control (MPC) which is attracted recently. Through this approach, we expect to identify and control various systems, including nonlinear and MIMO systems. Currently, our focus is on identifying systems, including physical phenomena that were previously challenging to model, and applying the proposed model to real systems.
