Nonlinear systems, unlike linear systems, are difficult to ensure stability. On the other hand, port-Hamiltonian systems are described by Hamilton's canonical equations with control input, which represent many physical systems. Such systems have the advantage that we can utilize the Hamiltonian function, representing the system's energy, as a Lyapunov function candidate in control. This control method is called "passivity-based control." 

Our research group develops nonlinear controllers for mechanical port-Hamiltonian systems by designing artificial potential functions that depend on position and velocity. The method enables us to ensure Lyapunov stability of the closed-loop system. Recently, we have worked on developing techniques to realize sliding mode control in the framework of passivity-based control by using nondifferentiable potential functions.
