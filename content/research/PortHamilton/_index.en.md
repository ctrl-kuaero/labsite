Unlike linear systems, nonlinear systems are difficult to ensure stability. 
Port-Hamiltonian systems, a subset of nonlinear systems, are described by Hamilton's canonical equations with added control inputs and can represent many physical systems. <!-- Port-Hamiltonian systems, one of such nonlinear systems, are described by Hamilton's canonical equations with control input and represent many physical systems. -->
A key advantage of such systems is the ability to utilize the Hamiltonian function, which represents the system's energy, as a Lyapunov function candidate in control. <!-- Such systems have the advantage that we can utilize the Hamiltonian function, representing the system's energy, as a Lyapunov function candidate in control. -->
This approach falls under the category of control methods known as “passivity-based control.”

Our research group studies nonlinear control methods for mechanical port-Hamiltonian systems by designing artificial potential functions that depend on position and velocity. 
The methods enable us to ensure Lyapunov stability of the closed-loop system. 
Recently, we have been focusing on developing techniques to realize sliding mode control within the framework of passivity-based control by using non-differentiable potential functions.
