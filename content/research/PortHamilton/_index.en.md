Unlike linear systems, nonlinear systems are difficult to ensure stability. 
Port-Hamiltonian systems, one of such nonlinear systems, are described by Hamilton's canonical equations with control input and represent many physical systems.  
Such systems have the advantage that we can utilize the Hamiltonian function, representing the system's energy, as a Lyapunov function candidate in control. 
This approach falls under the category of control methods known as “passivity-based control.”

Our research group studies nonlinear control methods for mechanical port-Hamiltonian systems by designing artificial potential functions that depend on position and velocity. 
The methods enable us to ensure Lyapunov stability of the closed-loop system. 
Recently, we focus on developing techniques to realize sliding mode control in the framework of passivity-based control by using non-differentiable potential functions.
