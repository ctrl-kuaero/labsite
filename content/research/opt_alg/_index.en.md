Refueling spacecraft in space is difficult, so it is an important issue to minimize fuel consumption. The trajectory with the minimum fuel consumption can be obtained by solving the $L^{1}$-optimal control problem, which is known to be difficult to solve. We are conducting research on various mathematical optimization algorithms, including algorithms for solving the $L^{1}$-optimal control problem. Specifically, the $L^{1}$-optimal control input is characterized by sparsity, i.e., it is zero for most of the control time, and can be used for control that takes advantage of this property.  

We also study optimization algorithms with stochastic parameters as a method for finding global optimal solutions to problems which have multiple local optimal solutions. This approach is expected to identify global optimal solutions even for problems where deterministic methods may only find local optimal solutions.  

We develop optimization algorithms for various purposes and conduct theoretical proofs of convergence and other properties.
