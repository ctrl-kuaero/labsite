Refueling spacecraft in space is difficult, so it is important issue to minimize fuel consumption. The trajectory with the minimum fuel consumption can be obtained by solving the $L_1$ optimal control problem, which is known to be difficult to solve. We are conducting research on algorithms that can efficiently solve the $L_1$ optimal control problem.
Furthermore, we are researching optimization algorithms that utilize stochastic parameters to find global optimal solutions. This approach is expected to identify global optimal solutions even for problems where deterministic methods may only find local optimal solutions.
In this way, we are developing optimization algorithms tailored to various applications and conducting theoretical proofs of convergence and other properties.
